# Toggle LED using buttons

This project is used to toggle the LED using P1.4 button. The button is used to

- change the color of the LED 2 using the P1.4 button
- The initial state is RED and pressing the button toggles the button to give RGB colors
- For this to work we had to use `Debouncing` for the switches.
